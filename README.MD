# What Is This?

This is a custom media server written in node JS to stream videos from a remote server.
This web system enables users to log into the system and view videos using the basic HTML 5 video player.

# Why?
- Universal and will run on any device with a web browser
- Supports buffering which is useful when connecting to a remote server
- Gained security because you don't need to grant everyone user accounts to view content from media server

# Why just not use Plex?
- Light weight
- Easy to install
- Easily expandable and hackable to fit your needs
